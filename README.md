# Welcome to Practical systems biology plant sciences 

This repository contains material for getting a first grasp on the delicate art of theoretical biology

Mayor topics 
=============

1. Python for systems biology
  * Reproducibility: Jupyter Notebooks, Docker, Git.
2. Model building
  * Choosing functional forms, network motifs for bistability and oscillations
3. Parameter inference
  * Algorithms for fitting non-linear models to data
  * The Geometry of the Cost landscape
  * Parameter uncertainty 
  * Parameter ensemble
4. Model validation
  * Interpreting the model and hypothesis generation
5. Model selection
  * Information based selection criteria, e.g. Akaike Information Criterion AIC
  * Model ensembles and uncertainty
